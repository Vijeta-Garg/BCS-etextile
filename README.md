What my project does:
Seamless aims to make life more seamless for breast cancer survivors by using haptic motors to mimic massage therapy in wearable! 

Why I made my project?:
I wanted to increase quality of life for breast cancer survivors. A lot of work is being done on improving diagnosis and treatment for cancer patients, but not enough is being done for dealing with lasting effects of the disease.

How I made my project:
I integrated haptic motors into strategic locations throughout the vest and programmed them to vibrate at different frequencies in different patterns. As of now (still WIP) this vest has two massage therapies it can perform:
- sort of mimics lymphatic therapy (via going along lymph nodes)
- attempts to sort of mimic oncological massage (via shorter strokes in a more localized area)

  Again this is only a v0 and is still being improved upon!

  What I struggled with/learned about:
  - Definitely learned how to e-sew. Integration is one of the hardest/most challenging parts of creating wearables and e-sewing helped me out a lot.
  - I learned how to be more precise with my soldering especially since I was using smaller components.
